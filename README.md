This is Artea's fork of TG created in byond.

Unlisted community for now until the requisite systems for a fun and playable round that isn't just vanilla TG are implemented.

Space Station 13 is a paranoia-laden round-based roleplaying game set against the backdrop of a nonsensical, metal death trap masquerading as a space station, with charming spritework designed to represent the sci-fi setting and its dangerous undertones. Have fun, and survive!

**Note**: Artea Station is less focused on the metal deathtrap part, and is more geared towards HRP with a mostly relaxed environment, unless a player makes the environment less safe.

## Important Note - TEST YOUR PULL REQUESTS

You are responsible for the testing of your content. You should not mark a pull request ready for review until you have actually tested it. If there are easy to find errors or warnings in the console, your PR will be unreadied.

Mappers: Make sure to spawn your map in and ensure it has no warnings about duplicate APCs, wirenets, or atmos pipe networks. Remember, many machines have builtin atmos/plumping pipes!

Coders: Just make sure your stuff works as intended, and doesn't drop runtimes.

## :exclamation: How to compile :exclamation:

Find `BUILD.bat` or `RUN_SERVER.bat` here in the root folder of this project, and double click it to initiate the build. It consists of multiple steps and might take around 1-5 minutes to compile.

**The long way**. Find `bin/build.cmd` in this folder, and double click it to initiate the build. It consists of multiple steps and might take around 1-5 minutes to compile. If it closes, it means it has finished its job. You can then [setup the server](.github/guides/RUNNING_A_SERVER.md) normally by opening `tgstation.dmb` in DreamDaemon.

**Building tgstation in DreamMaker directly is now deprecated and might produce errors**, such as `'tgui.bundle.js': cannot find file`.

[/tg/station HACKMD account](https://hackmd.io/@tgstation) - TG design documentation here. Do keep in mind that we don't follow these, but there are some good code insights. One of particular note for featurecoders is the one on how to write a [good design doc](https://hackmd.io/@tgstation/BkzmU9EyK).

**Interested in some starting lore?**  
We have some basic lore for a couple of the species, as well as an overarching story. Message Kepteyn on discord if you're interested in writing compact, concise lore! Extra fluff may come later.
