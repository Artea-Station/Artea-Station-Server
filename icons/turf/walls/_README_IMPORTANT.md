## About Output Names

So yeah, these icons have a particular set of output names.  
This was done to preserve that's left of my already pretty fucked sanity.

- "stripe" should be used for neighbor stripes.
- "wall" for the walls themselves.
- "shine" for *any* shine. Stripe/wall/whatever, it's all the same name.
