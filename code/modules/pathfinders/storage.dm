This policy covers everything from space travel accidents to intergalactic pet care.

<br> \
Section 2: Coverage for Intergalactic Pet Care <br> \
We understand that pets are important members of your family, even in the year 623. That's why this policy includes coverage for all pet-related expenses, including medical care, grooming, and even intergalactic pet hotels. <br> \
<br> \
Section 3: Coverage for Cyber Attacks <br> \

In the unlikely event that you are abducted by extraterrestrial beings, this policy provides coverage for any medical expenses, including examinations and treatments for injuries or illnesses resulting from the abduction. This policy also covers any property damage caused during the abduction, including damage to vehicles or buildings. In addition, we offer a reimbursement for any lost wages or income resulting from the abduction. Please note that this coverage is subject to verification by our claims department and may require documentation of the abduction event. <br> \
<br> \
Section 6: Illegal to Die <br> \
Please note that it is illegal to die in the year 623. Any individuals found to be deceased will not be covered under this policy. However, in the event of a near-death experience, this policy covers all medical expenses related to resuscitation and recovery. <br> \
<br> \
