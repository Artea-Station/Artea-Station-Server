## Pathfinders Mapping Spec

Generally should be situated near the other shuttle docks at arrivals.

They shouldn't be too far from cargo.

### Items

- A materials locker
- A tools locker
- A PathVend
- A department techfab
- A Pathfinder Leader locker
- Some miscellaneous low-end medical gear, like epipens, sutures, meshes, and potentially a couple of patches for brute damage.
- Two pathfinder medkits
- Five flashlights.
- Two mining lockers.
- One mining points machine.

### Weapons

**These should be in secure lockers that only the captain and pathfinder lead has access to.**

- Three energy-based guns.
- One low-end ballistic sidearm. For when things get bad.
  - Ballistics have bad collateral damage compared to lasers, and *will* destroy walls.
- Five survival knives.

### Rooms

- A lobby. This is where the recreation area of sorts for the pathfinders is.
- A dock of suitable size for their shuttle. Ideally not secluded, and it should have a few windows for folk to peek in at the shuttle from within the station.
- A storeroom. This is where the techfab, plus the vendor, and few lockers reside.
- A Pathfinder Lead office. This doesn't have to be big or impressive, as their real one is the shuttle. Contains their locker, computer, and PDA/ID painter.

### Other Provisions

- They should use `pathfinder_purple` as their floor decals.
- If colouring something for them, the `COLOR_PATHFINDERS_PURPLE` and `COLOR_PATHFINDERS_DARK_PURPLE` defines are the two primary colours they use.
