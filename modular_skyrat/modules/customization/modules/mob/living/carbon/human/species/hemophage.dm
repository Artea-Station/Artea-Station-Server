	return list("Though known by many other names, 'Hemophages' are those that have found themselves the host of a bloodthirsty infection. Initially entering their hosts through the bloodstream, or activating after a period of dormancy in infants, this infection initially travels to the chest first. Afterwards, it infects several cells, making countless alterations to their genetic sequence, until it starts rapidly expanding and taking over every nearby organ, notably the heart, lungs, and stomach, forming a massive tumor vaguely reminiscent of an overgrown, coal-black heart, that hijacks them for its own benefit, and in exchange, allows the host to 'sense' the quality, and amount of blood currently occupying their body.",
	"While this kills the host initially, the tumor will jumpstart the body and begin functioning as a surrogate to keep their host going. This does confer certain advantages to the host, in the interest of keeping them alive; working anaerobically, requiring no food to function, and extending their lifespan dramatically. However, this comes at a cost, as the tumor changes their host into an obligate hemophage; only the enzymes, and iron in blood being able to fuel them. If they are to run out of blood, the tumor will begin consuming its own host.",
	"Historically, Hemophages have caused great societal strife through their very existence. Many have reported dread on having someone reveal they require blood to survive, worse on learning they have been undead, espiecally in 'superstitious' communities. In many places they occupy a sort of second class, unable to live normal lives due to their condition being a sort of skeleton in their closet. Some can actually be found in slaughterhouses or the agricultural industry, gaining easy access to a large supply of animal blood to feed their eternal thirst.",
	"Others find their way into mostly-vampiric communities, turning others into their own kind; though, the virus can only transmit to hosts that are incredibly low on blood, taking advantage of their reduced immune system efficiency and higher rate of blood creation to be able to survive the initial few days within their host.",
