      areas.
  itsmeow (original), RimiNosha (port):
  - qol: TGUI colour picker! Check it out!

  RimiNosha:
  - bugfix: The server should start much more smoothly.

      smoke added to them.
  - qol: Explosions look much cooler and have many more particles to them!
  - imageadd: Added a newer and much cooler explosion sprite (grabbed from Mojave
      Sun)
2024-01-22:
  RimiNosha:
  - balance: Robotic limbs (including synths) now take pressure damage.
  - balance: Synths now take 150% heat damage (down from 200%).
  - rscadd: Added a project room to Bearcat.
  - rscdel: Pathfinders and their shuttle. Lead Pathfinders are now glorified ship
      pilots.

  Kapu (original), RimiNosha (port):
  - rscadd: ZAS, a blazing fast, if somewhat simplified atmos system.
  - rscdel: LINDA (our old, slow as balls atmos system)
  - rscadd: Explosive decompression, which is, as the name suggests, dangerous.
  - balance: Space is no longer magically ultra-cold for pipes.
  - qol: Air alarms now have inbuilt heaters. They're nowhere near as powerful as
      space heaters, though!
  - rscdel: Aninoblium, Hypernoblium, Freon, Halon, Healium, Pluoxium, Nitrium, BZ,
      Masma, Proto Nitrate, Zauker.
  - spellcheck: Water Vapour > Steam
  - rscadd: Alium, a fucked gas that will have random attributes each round.
  - rscadd: Deuterium, which burns ~20% hotter than hydrogen.
  - rscadd: Argon, Neon, Krypton, Xenon, Boron, which are all noble gases with differing
      behaviours.
  - rscadd: Methane, which is stinky, as is the replacement for Miasma.
  - rscadd: Ammonia, Chlorine, Methyl Bromide, Nitrogen Dioxide, all of which are
      potent toxins.
  - rscadd: Nitric Oxide, Sulfur Dioxide.
  - rscadd: Walls can now melt from high temperatures.
  - rscdel: Openturf fusion. Replacement coming in the near future.
  - rscdel: HFR. Not like many folk knew the thing even existed, nevermind how it
      works.
  - rscdel: Pressure resistance. Anything not anchored will be moved by pressure effects.
  QuacksQ:
  - rscadd: Examining things will now put a message into the chat for people nearby
      to see what you just looked at.
  - balance: Crawling is much slower now
  - balance: Diagonal movement is slower than normal cardinal movement.
  RimiNosha:
  - bugfix: Firing range is no longer spaced round start.
  - code_imp: Hulks now take burn damage from pressure. Not that anyone outside of
      admins would be able to notice.
  - balance: Extreme pressures damage your eyes and ears, and also hurts just a little
      more. Better bring a space suit!
