  RimiNosha:
  - rscadd: Humans now can select ears and tails. Other parts to come later.
  - qol: Overhauled the prefs menu. There now should be far less information overload
      for new players in the future.
  - qol: All species can now pick their exact colors, instead of being restricted
      to a list. Moths do not use this system, due to them using pre-colored icons.

  - qol: You can now rotate both directions in preferences.
  - code_imp: The preference datum is now passed to preference.apply_to_human, allowing
      them to read other prefs.
  - bugfix: Fixes TGUI dev server not working on byond 514.
  - bugfix: Pixel scaling is now used for the preview in the prefs UI. Not noticeable
      at the moment cause we don't allow rescaling yet.
  - qol: Lighting is now notably more dim and warm. Most places will have very noticeably
      darker lighting.
  - qol: Night shift now actually feels dim.

      enough.
