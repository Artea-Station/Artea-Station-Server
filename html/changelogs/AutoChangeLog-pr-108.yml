  - rscdel: "Tier 4 parts."
  - bugfix: "Fixed vendors not giving a part list on scan via RPED. Don't ask me how."

  - balance: "RPED is now normal in size, now it has a niche instead of being complete garbage."
  - balance: "The print prices and resource values of stock parts have been increased tenfold."
  - balance: "All stock parts post basic now require ~T2 and ~T3 materials. (T2: titanium/silver, T3: uranium/plasma/diamond)"
  - balance: "Stock parts recycle for much more than they used to, with the maximum possible being ~64% (taking into account no T4) compared to almost 10% before."
  - balance: "ARPEDs additionally cost plasma to make now."
  - qol: "RPEDs can now dump their contents into a disposal unit, similarly to trash bags."
