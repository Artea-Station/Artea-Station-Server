changes:
  - rscadd: "Humans now can select ears and tails. Other parts to come later."
  - qol: "Overhauled the prefs menu. There now should be far less information overload for new players in the future."
  - qol: "All species can now pick their exact colors, instead of being restricted to a list. Moths do not use this system, due to them using pre-colored icons."
  - soundadd: "Added a small sound when characters are selected."
  - soundadd: "A misc extra sound for mouseclicks, currently unused."
  - rscdel: "Effectively removes the random and hardcore random prefs."
  - bugfix: "Cat tails should now be visible when facing south again."
  - code_imp: "De-spaghetti'd skin_tone code."
  - code_imp: "Minimum age is now 18."
  - rscdel: "Removed agender and dyncolor traits."
  - rscdel: "Removed mutant colours and ethereal colours from DNA. Skin_tone now handles that, with species.fixed_mut_color being used for statically colored races (golems)."
  - qol: "You can now rotate both directions in preferences."
  - code_imp: "The preference datum is now passed to preference.apply_to_human, allowing them to read other prefs."
  - bugfix: "Fixes TGUI dev server not working on byond 514."
  - bugfix: "Pixel scaling is now used for the preview in the prefs UI. Not noticeable at the moment cause we don't allow rescaling yet."
